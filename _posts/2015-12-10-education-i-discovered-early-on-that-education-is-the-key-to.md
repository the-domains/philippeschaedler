Education I discovered early on that education is the key to being a successful and happy hairstylist. Continuing education is what makes our industry so much fun because it promotes creativity and passion. Education has always been a big part of my work as a hairstylist, starting back in Europe when I was still in my teens and continuing to this day. Just as in other professions, attending seminars to learn the latest developments in their fields, the best hair stylists also take advantage of classes and workshops to learn and become familiar with the latest products and techniques. I have taken advanced classes with the Toni&Guy Academy every few months for many years. From precision haircutting to color correction to the latest trends in styling and hair care, I love it all! I find it exciting to be presented with the latest discoveries, which I can then bring back to you, the client, with the utmost confidence.
